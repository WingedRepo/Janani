Designed a website to provide 360 degree care to pregnant women, 24/7. Below are a few features of our website. There are other many more features too.

According to a survey conducted, 1 out of every 17 miscarriages happen due to a lack of awareness and information about pregnancy and its needs. 

A solution to provide digital pregnancy support accessible to pregnant women specifically in India, regardless of caste, creed, race, religious, socioeconomic, cultural, and geographical background, using Artificial intelligence.
Here's a presentation for our solution :

We are providing a solution that provides 360 degree care to pregnant women.
We have divided our target audience into two groups :
1. the rural women
2. the urban women

Overview : 
 Guided a team of 3 to design a website providing 360 degree care to pregnant women. Modeled a Web Scraper
to scrape ASHA workers’ data from Govt. website. Built a Chatbot for round-the-clock queries.
◦ Programmed a Health Status Prediction Model to predict user’s health status, trained using Random
Forest Classification Algorithm for tracking and displaying data of Hospitals within 20 km proximity of
current location in real time.
◦ Designed and integrated three other features including a Mood Tracker for insightful mood analysis, Song
Playlist Player leveraging scientific Alpha and Beta wave music for optimized listening and a Digital Journal.

Our features include : 
1.  Information about local support services and schemes such as Asha Bahu, scraping government websites for the data of health workers and making it availvable to the general public
2.	Location detection of nearby Hospitals, using Random Forest Classification Algorithm
3.	Chat Bot for additional support using AI
4.	Note-taking feature for journalling their pregnancy journey
5.	Scientifically approved songs’ playlists for mood upliftment and for soothing, calming, and positive effects.
6.  ML trained BP model
7.  Mood and craving tracker

The Tech Stacks used are : 
•	HTML
•	CSS
•	JavaScript
•	MongoDB
•	NodeJS
•	Python
•	Canva
•	Git & GitHub
•	Figma
•	Flask
•	PyPDF2 (Python Library)

Future Scope : 
1. video guide for rural women
2. multiple language support
3. share data with government
4. Community support
5. SOS feature through which an sos will be sent to one hospital and emergency contacts when a button is pressed for 3 secs
6. Monetization by allowing companies to sell their baby care and other products on site (we value our users and don't want to extort money from them xD)
